Lark Street is often referred to as the “Greenwich Village” of Albany’s Capital Region. The area along Lark Street is reminiscent of the great and colorful neighborhoods of Manhattan, and is just steps from downtown Albany’s business district. Brownstones from the nineteenth century line the streets, many of which are occupied by commercial tenants who have been there for decades, giving the street a decidedly vintage feel. This once-rustic neighborhood features cobblestone intersections that add to is Greenwich ambiance. <br /><br />Residents lunch at cafes during the day, enjoy cocktails and shop in the numerous boutiques. Lark Street is well known for the diverse selection of foods on offer, from Tex-Mex to Greek to Thai, Indian, Hunan, and more.",

The area along Lark Street is reminiscent of the great and colorful neighborhoods of Manhattan, and is just steps from downtown Albany’s business district. Brownstones from the nineteenth century line the streets, many of which are occupied by commercial tenants who have been there for decades, giving the street a decidedly vintage feel. This once-rustic neighborhood features cobblestone intersections that add to is Greenwich ambiance.<br /><br />Residents lunch at cafes during the day, enjoy cocktails and shop in the numerous boutiques. Lark Street is well known for the diverse selection of foods on offer, from Tex-Mex to Greek to Thai, Indian, Hunan, and more.",

A hidden gem tucked on a quiet tree lined road, but only 7 minutes to MVP Arena and a short distance to SUNY Albany, Russell Sage College, AMC & St. Peters & Albany College of Pharmacy. Perfect for family/friend gatherings. This newly renovated 4BR/2BA home is designed with inviting modern/ Scandinavian interiors & all the amenities you need for a relaxing visit.",

Walking distance to public nature preserve. -One neighboring house at the back of the property. Less visible when trees come in spring/summer.<br /><br />Please keep in mind the road leading to the cottage is fairly narrow and has some potholes. It is a single lane so drive slowly and be cautious of oncoming traffic.",
